# landing_page
A landing page i will build for The Odin Project.

Special thanks to my wife for the amazing pictures.

The goal of this project was to practice the subject we learned so far like.

- HTML
- Css
- Flexbox
- Git

During the project I learned a lot. I finally understand how flexbox works, before I just tried different things.
But now I actually know what commands to use. Git also seems really usefull. Before i worked on projects and 
changed a few things and my code broke. It took me a while to fix it again because i wasnt sure where it happend.
But now with Git i could just go back to before it broke.

I'm excited to learn more and work on my next project.
